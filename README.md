## 📖 Project Purpose
This project is an interactive web application to visualize **Prim's Algorithm** for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a weighted undirected graph. Built with Python and Streamlit, it allows users to:
- Create and edit graphs interactively
- Watch step-by-step or animated construction of the MST
- See real-time edge selection and MST cost updates

## 🌟 What is Prim's Algorithm?
Prim's Algorithm is a greedy algorithm that finds a minimum spanning tree for a weighted undirected graph. It starts from an arbitrary node and grows the MST by always choosing the minimum-weight edge that connects a visited node to an unvisited node.

**Applications:** Network design, circuit design, clustering, etc.

## ⏱️ Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(E log V) using a min-heap (priority queue)
- **Space Complexity:** O(V + E) for storing the graph and heap

Where V = number of vertices, E = number of edges.
